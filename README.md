# _Foodagatchi_

#### _A tamagotchi project where the user can choose and care for multiple tamagotchi friends. November 2019_

#### By _**Lauren Musante and Christine Frank**_

## Description

_In this game, the user chooses how many friends ("Foodagatchis") they'd like to take care of, with a limit of 4. The user enters their friends' names, and chooses what type of "Foodagatchi" they'd like, based on a dropdown menu of 5 different options. Once the game starts, the Foodagatchi needs to be fed and put to sleep with button clicks, and needs to be pet using a mouse-over motion. If too much time passes before being cared for, the Foodagatchi becomes sad before becoming angry. The user can tell what their Foodagatchi's mood is based on what their eyes look like._
